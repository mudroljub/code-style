# JavaScript Code Style (no semicolons)

My personal semicolon-less JS coding style, which I have been using and updating regularly since 2017.

To try it out, just download the [ESLint config file](.eslintrc.json).

Visit [ESLint website](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) to see what the rule means and how to set it up.
